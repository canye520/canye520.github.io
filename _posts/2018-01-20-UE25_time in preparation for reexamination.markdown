The implication of fallen flowers

——the first poem writing for future:

Silently at noon yesterday,
the flowers were fading.
Because of forgetting its name,
you turned to consult me.
But I say I know nothing.

A long time had passed,
then a laughter came out suddenly.
You regarded me as a fake,
fake scientist in detail.
Actually I could not argue.

That night I lit my lamp to read,
bit lips, beat breast and stamped feet
only for reshaping status or prestige.
But I failed to imagine its difficulties,
which equal the Shu Road or the heaven.

Coldly at morning today,
the heat originated from back
made meditation fruit.
You brought a wind coat to me,
then I knew the implication of fallen flowers.

落花之意：写给未来的诗1

昨日寂静午间
行将衰落的花
你想不起名字
于是转身问我
我说我也不知

此后许久过了
突然笑声传出
你称我是冒牌
冒牌的科学家
我竟无力辩解

是夜挑灯苦读
咬牙捶胸顿足
只为重拾颜面
不想个中荆棘
比肩蜀道青天

今日刺骨清晨
忽觉背后一热
冥思终成正果
你把风衣送来
我明落花之意

Today, basketball accompanied me all day and sent me a present——crus cramp——which makes me have no choice but to use study instead of sport. Now my heart can be seen as a mixture of sadness and joy, how interesting it is!

Wangyi Cloud Music tells me that frequency of the word ‘heart’ equaling 993 hit the top position among all lyrics I have ever heard in 2017. It exceeds my expectation but within the bound of reason.

She also mentions me that 24th Feb may be a special day for me since I listened to Fifth Melody of the Night performed by Shi Jin many times. However, I really cannot grasp its particularity, I do not know why 47 became the amount of listening to that music on that day as if I do not understand how do I possess the present appearance step by step. 

Extremely the world is fantastic, she always bringing curiosity into our heart with no end.

今天，篮球陪伴了我一天并送给我一份礼物：小腿抽筋，这让我除了用学习代替运动外别无选择。现在我的心悲喜交加，多么有意思！

网易云音乐告诉我2017我听到最多的歌词是“心”，达到993次，这既出乎我意料，又在情理之中。

她还提醒我，对我而言，2月24日也许是特别的一天，因为我把石进的《夜的钢琴曲五》听了很多次。然而，我真的不知道特别在何处，我不知道为什么那一天听这首曲子听了47次，就好像我无法理解我是如何一步一步成为今天这般模样的。

这世界如此奇妙，它总把好奇植入我们内心，并且源源不断。

用英文写日记实在是件遭罪的事，我偷回懒。

中国的大学什么时候能成为中国的大学呢? 我是指：什么时候我们可以脱口而出：我有一个想法，我来做个展示，而不是脱口而出：我有一个idea，我来做个presentation.

因为落后，我们学习了人家这么多年，该有点骨气做点超越人家的事，比如，有一天，让汉语成为西方研究生入学考试的必考科目。

昨天网易云带着她对用户听歌的记录刷爆朋友圈，今天支付宝带着他对用户消费的记录同样刷爆朋友圈。他和她，一个管着物质，一个管着精神，他和她，好像牛郎和织女，离牵手只差一座桥的距离。

过去的一年是漂泊的一年，他告诉我，说我一共坐了17次火车，花费3497.50元，这数字多少超出了我的意料。2次往返于长春和长沙，3次往返于长春和北京，1次往返于长春和哈尔滨，1次去往北京，1次去往长沙，1次去往益阳，还有2次忘了。平均每次205.73元，有点小贵，至今可恶的花呗小朋友还时不时拽着我的手，嚷嚷着：欠债还钱，天经地义。

全年总消费14226.25元，月均1185.52元，加上其他渠道的消费，实际应该在1500到2000之间吧，不知道算什么水平，唯一肯定的是花了不少冤枉钱。当然像北京房租这种大贪官不在统计范围内，他必须被剔除出去，以告慰天下苍生。

Snowflakes
——the 2th poem written for future

In the south of China,
many snowflakes with dust
fall onto highways and byways.

With each other,
sprays on the window
bond, play and have fun.
Now and then, one by one,
they make many drawings naturally.

Children waken from dream
are discontented with natural presents.
On sprays with young hands carefully,
they depict snowflakes in their eyes.

To take advantage of free time,
adults returning from work
are also unwilling to fall behind.
In the place where children cannot reach,
by staring at remote mountain,
they confide stories in their heart.

Because of the continuity of the creation,
you eventually crawl out from warm bed.
In that moment,
the cold wind swallow you.
But suddenly,
winter clothes, neckerchief,
together with ginger decoction,
throng into the house.

Through the arts in window,
you say you have observed
pureness, kindness and honesty,
and have touched
gladness, gratitude and happiness,
and also have tasted
all the beauty of human world
which cast light on by snowflakes.

I ask you what the beauty is.
You answer me without thinking:
it is friendship, romance and familial affection.
Smiling with shyness, you speak again:
It is also the love which includes the above three.
The loving process converts two persons’ relationship 
from the stranger into the friend firstly,
from the friend into the sweetheart secondly,
and from the sweetheart into the relative ultimately.

雪花：写给未来的诗2

中国南方
粒粒雪花
夹杂尘土
飘落
大街小巷

窗上水雾
你来我往
嬉戏打闹
不时勾勒出
一幅幅
浑然天成的图画

从梦中苏醒的孩子
对这自然的馈赠
并不满意
他们拖着稚嫩的双手
在这水雾上
一笔一划
描绘着
他们眼里的雪花

劳作归来的大人
趁着这难得的闲暇
也不甘落后
他们望着远方的大山
在孩子们够不着的地方
一点一线
诉说着
他们心中的故事

如火如荼的创作
终于让你爬出温暖被窝
那一刹
刺骨寒风吞没了你
但很快
冬衣围巾
加上姜汤
纷至沓来

透过窗户上的艺术品
你说你看到了
纯洁、善良与真诚
触摸到了
欣喜、感动和幸福
也品尝到了
雪花映照下的
人间一切美好

我问你
这美好指什么
你不假思索
友情、恋情、亲情啊
又含羞一笑
还有囊括三者的爱情
从外人，到朋友
从朋友，到恋人
从恋人，到亲人

Last night, a mysterious dream came to me.
I wanted to remember it, but actually forgot it. When can we own a machine specializing in awakening memory?

以下 9-20 行由中译者删去\[还这么大张旗鼓告诉人家\]……大概在作者80年代翻译时，这些语言还算尺度很大吧? 

留个记录，优美的史诗以后还是不要“偷工减料”的好

"That is he, Shamhat! Release your clenched arms,
“是他！神妓啊，快袒露你那胸襟！

expose your sex so he can take in your voluptuousness.
暴露你的性别，以便他能注意到你那丰满体态。

Do not be restrained--take his energy!
不要克制——要吸走他的能量！

When he sees you he will draw near to you.
当他看见你时，他就会向你靠近。

Spread out your robe so he can lie upon you,
摊开你的袍服，以便他能躺在你的身上。

and perform for this primitive the task of womankind!
然后你就去为了这个莽汉执行你的女性任务吧！

His animals, who grew up in his wilderness, will become alien to him,
长于他那蛮荒之地的野兽们，将会同他疏远。

and his lust will groan over you."
而他那强烈的性欲，将会在你身上呻吟。”

Shamhat unclutched her bosom, exposed her sex, and he took in her voluptuousness.
神妓不再紧握她的胸襟，她暴露她的性别，让他注意到她那丰满体态。

She was not restrained, but took his energy.
她没有克制，却吸走了他的能量。

She spread out her robe and he lay upon her,
她摊开她的袍服，而他躺在她的身上。

she performed for the primitive the task of womankind.
她为了这个莽汉执行者她的女性任务。

His lust groaned over her;
他那强烈性欲，在她身上呻吟。
