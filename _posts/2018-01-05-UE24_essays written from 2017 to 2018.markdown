From now on, I will use English for recording my daily life in Wechat Friends Circle.

Maybe my English is poor, but I believe one day I will be good at it, and sharing my writing with each other, in my opinion, could be a effective way for me to achieve this goal.

Now, it is 20:21 Beijing time, and I am in Beijing Subway Line 5, carrying a big suitcase and shouldering a medium-size backpack.

Tomorrow will be a fantanstic day and I will go into a new step, begining to prepare for 2018 China Postgraduate Entrance Examination.

Good night, all my friends, we are living in a great era which must belong to transformation and revolution, and this unprecendented change will liberate all our human permanatly one day, best wishes to all of you.

从今天开始，我将用英语在微信朋友圈记录我每天的生活。

也许我的英语很差，但我相信有一天我会很好地做到这一点，在我看来，和别人分享我的文字可以成为我实现这个目标的有效方式。

现在是北京时间20点21分，我在北京地铁5号线，提着一个大手提箱，背着一个中型背包。

明天将是一个有趣的日子，我将进入一个新的阶段，开始为2018年的中国研究生入学考试做准备。

晚安，我的朋友们，我们生活在一个属于变革和革命的伟大时代，这种前所未有的改变将在某一天永久地解放我们全人类，向你们所有人致以最美好的祝愿。

I had not supposed that I received so many responses, 58 thumbs-up and 40 remarks, to my yesterday’s Wechat Friends Circle. So before I start write today, I want to express my sincere thanks to all of you, my dear friends known in junior high school, senior high school, the Northeast Normal University and Postgraduate Entrance Reexamination of Reming University, my honorable teachers giving me a lot of subtle but far-reaching influence, my pleasant colleagues working with me now in National Survey Research Center at RUC, and of course, my hospitable relations, my amiable and lovely parents. 
Today, I first know the meanings of ‘duc’ and ‘duct’. They are all roots originated from Latin and means ‘to lead’. I think, since the ‘e’ means ‘out’, the literal sense of word ‘education’ including ‘e’ and ‘duc’ is to drag people from their nearly closed world to a completely new field. It is well known that Chinese education exits a great deal of problems, so it is our duty to help our nation in conquering them gradually. 

<div align="center"><p>
<img src="/assets/img/University_Essay/ruc2.2.jpg">
</p></div>

From my perspective, the central thing educator should do is to arouse students’ thirst for our nature, our society and ourselves because the curiosity will automatically guide them into learning corresponding knowledge and getting related ability. My greatest wish is that I can see the curiosity from the eyes of almost all our people, not only our children but our adults, when I have to say goodbye to the world perpetually. Maybe one day I can do something for Chinese educational revolution, maybe I cannot. But, anyhow, I hope one day some people or some organizations could make our nation’s education come back to its essence.
 I would have liked to record something about my diet in following two images, but now it is 22:15 Beijing Time and it is time for bed. About 300 words’ writing consumes nearly 3 hours, how slow it is! Good night, Sweet dreams!

让我没有想到的是，我昨天发的微信朋友圈收到了如此多的回复，58 个赞和 40 条评论。所以在今天开始写作前，我想向你们所有人表达我最真诚的谢意，你们是：在初中，高中，在东北师范大学和在中国人民大学研究生复试期间与我相识的朋友们，给我很多微小但又意义深远影响的老师们，现在在中国人民大学中国调查与数据中心与我并肩工作的我的同事们，当然还有我热情好客的亲人们，以及我可亲可敬可爱的爸爸和妈妈。 

今天，我第一次知道 'duc' 和 'duct' 的含义。他们都是源于拉丁语的词根，意思是 '指引、引导'。我认为，因为 'e' 意味着 '出'，而 'education' 一词包括 'e' 和 'duc'，所以教育（education）一词的本意是把人们从他们几乎封闭的世界中拖拽出来，引导他们去向一个崭新的领域。众所周知，中国教育存在着大量的问题，所以帮助我们的国家逐步解决这些问题是我们的责任。

从我的角度来看，教育家的中心任务应该是唤醒学生对自然界、社会以及我们自身的好奇心，因为这种好奇心会自动地引导他们学习到相应的知识，同时获取相应的能力。我最大的愿望是，当哪天我不得不永远地和这个世界说再见的时候，我可以从我们所有人，不仅仅是我们的孩子，也包括我们的成年人的眼中看到一颗颗好奇之心在闪闪发光。也许有一天我能够为中国的教育改革做点什么，也许我不能。但是，无论如何，我希望有一天有人或有些组织可以让我们国家的教育真正回归它的本质。

我原本还想记录一些关于下面两张图片反映的我的日常饮食生活，但是现在已经是北京时间 22:15 了，是时候该睡觉了。约 300 字的写作消耗了将近 3 小时，多么的慢啊！

晚安，好梦 ！

Up to now, I have worked at RUC for 37 days, and I have left NENU for 41 days. How fast time flies away! By my reckoning, the Renming University and the Northeast Normal University are both of a size, but differ in the shape. The former resembles a square, the latter a rectangle. 

Afternoon, I received a physical report from campus hospital. The physical I went for last Monday comprises following items: height, weight, vision, blood pressure, internal medicine, surgery, abdominal ultrasonography, electrocardiogram, X-ray of chest, urinalysis, and complete blood count. Luckily all are normal.

When I write these words, a sudden message from Sichuan shocks me that a magnitude 7 earthquake have happened in Jiuzhaigou County, Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture at 21:19 Beijing Time. The focal depth is 20 km and it is only 6 km deep of 512 Wenchuan earthquake. The violent earthquake happened in Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture again 9 years later……Best blessing to Jiuzhai, to Aba, to Sichuan, if only everything and everyone are well,

到目前为止，在人大工作有 37 天了，离开东北师大有 41 天了，时间过得真快啊！据我估计，中国人民大学和东北师范大学两个大小相同，但形状不大一样。前者像个正方形，后者像个长方形。

下午，我收到校园医院的体格检查报告。上周一做的这个体格检查包括如下项目： 身高、 体重、 视力、 血压、 内科、 外科、 腹部B超、 心电图、 胸部X射线、 尿检以及血常规。幸运的是都很正常。     
     
当我写到这里时，来自四川的突然消息震惊了我。北京时间21:19 在阿坝藏族羌族自治州九寨沟县发生里氏 7 级地震。这次地震震源深度 20 公里，仅比 5·12 汶川大地震深 6 公里。阿坝藏族羌族自治州在9年以后再次发生强烈地震……为九寨祈福，为阿坝祈福，为四川祈福，愿一切安好。

Following are two pictures, the former was taken at 5:29 p.m., and the latter on yesterday.

No matter how the heavens feels, the bus I was in conveys me from 4th North Ring Road to 3th North Ring Road between 6:50 a.m. and 7:20 a.m., then does the same thing backwards between 5:20 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. everyday. So I extremely want, one day, I would present an enormous decoration to her, with two Chinese characters ‘Lao Mo’ inscribed on it. Of course, the honor does not all belong to her, otherwise the little child named Mobike will fly into rages, blow me out of the water and shout at me: have you totally blocked out the entire time I carried you to the bus stop? You’ll see, ugly boy; you’ll see how many tardy days approach you!

The right picture is a test result of Cattell Sixteen Personality Factor Questionaire filled in Last Monday, The high fantasy score makes me happy, but the high sophistication score reversely. Actually I always imagine aimlessly and, in my view, no disruptive innovations originate from rational thinking, but since my dream is simple, see our world become better and better, eat lychee every day and be a child forever, how could I be a sophisticated person? 

My intuition tells me that questionnaire together with sampling survey will be a historical heritage after 20 to 30 years. The reason is uncomplicated, the sampling survey consumes a great deal of manpower and financial resources, but data from it are unauthentic. Most of ourselves including me cannot bear that now our questionnaire requires our interviewees to answer so many questions, most of ourselves including me will subconsciously give untrue answers to the interviewer they never met before. Concealing our true feeling from everyone, not only strangers but also friends or relations, is our inherent ability, there is nothing to blame and it is that brings the colorful human society. Luckily, more and more micro-computer connecting with Internet will liberate all investigators permanently and provide more credible data one day!

As I write these words, in the distance I heard Mr. Du’ s voice: Looking back Changan hill resembling piles of embroidery, thousands of doors open in turn at mountaintop. The horse makes the dust risen and concubine smiles, but nobody know the reason is the coming of lychee.

以下是两张图片，前者拍摄于下午 5:29，后者拍摄于昨天。

无论老天爷的心情如何，我所做的这两巴士每天都会在早上6:50 到 7:20 这个时段将我从北四环送至北三环，然后在下午5:20 到 9:00 这个时段将我从北三环拉回北四环。所以我非常希望，有一天，我能送给她一个大大的奖章，奖章上刻上两个汉字“劳模”。当然，这份荣誉并不全部属于她，否则名为 Mobike 的小孩就会大发雷霆，将我摧毁，然后吼道：你难道忘记了我拖着你去公交车站的日子了吗？你会看到的，你这个丑陋的男孩，你会看到以后将有多少迟到在等着你！   

右图是上个星期一填写的卡特尔 16 人格因素问卷显示的测试结果，高幻想性得分让我开心，但高世故性得分则刚好相反。实际上我总是漫无目的想象，且在我看来，没有哪个颠覆性创新来源于理性思考，但既然我的梦想很简单，就是看看我们的世界变得越来越好，每天吃荔枝，以及永远做个孩子，我怎么可能是个高世故性的人呢？ 

我的直觉告诉我，问卷连同抽样调查一起将在20到30年之后成为历史的遗产。原因很简单：抽样调查要消耗大量的人力和财力，但由它获得的数据并不可信。我们大多数人（包括我）都不能忍受，现在我们的问卷要求受访者去回答这么多的问题，同时我们大多数人（包括我自己）会下意识地向素昧平生的访员提供不真实的答案。对所有人，无论是陌生人还是朋友或者亲戚，隐瞒我们自身的真实感受，是我们与身俱来的能力。这没有什么好责备的，相反正是这一点带来了今天丰富多彩的人类社会。幸运的是，越来越多与互联网连接的微计算机将在未来的某一天永久地解放所有调查人员，并给人们提供更为可靠的数据！

当我写到这里时，我听到了杜先生的声音：长安回望绣成堆，山顶千门次第开。一骑红尘妃子笑，无人知是荔枝来。

My diary has suspended for 9 days, now about 80% of my work can run automatically. Though it is not an ideal result for me and the programs still thrown a tantrum irregularly, but this degree has helped me a lot. Thanks three figures very much: a script language AutoHotkey used for simulating mouse and keyboard, a script language R designed for data analysis specially and a strong plug-in Vimvum which can help us dispense with mouse when we browse the web through Google Chrome. 

Last night, I saw my two college classmates off at Beijing Railway Station who were leaving for ChangChun where they are readying for Postgraduate Entrance Examination. At the same time, I became the only one in Beijing among 4 people, who ever wanted to revise for the exam in there. If I remember correctly, the prophecy my university dormitory leader said has unfortunately come true.

Tomorrow is an overtime for me, so the writing now should be stopped. See you tomorrow night, sweet dreams，all my friends!

我的日记已经暂停9 天了，现在约有 80%的工作实现了自动化。虽然这对于我来说不算是个理想的结果，而且程序时不时地会耍耍小脾气，但这样的程度还是大大地帮到了我。感谢这三个软件：可用于模拟鼠标键盘操作的脚本语言 AutoHotkey，为数据分析量身打造的脚本语言 R 以及可以帮助我们脱离鼠标浏览网页的强大的谷歌插件 Vimvum。 

昨天晚上，我送我的两个大学同学去了北京火车站，他们要去往长春，他们将在那里准备研究生入学考试。与此同时，我成了当初想过要在北京准备二战的 4 人中的唯一1个在北京准备考试的人。如果我没记错的话，我大学寝室长不幸预言了这一事实。 

明天有一天加班，所以写作到现在应该停止了。明晚再见，美梦，所有的朋友们！

A moment ago, I read some news about the formally launch of Cervarix in mainland China after 11 years, when this type of vaccine was approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration. So the following I will try to write something relevant to the cervical cancer and female health.

What is cervix? It is the narrow passage at the end of woman’s vagina, and in other words, the opening of a woman’s womb where babies develop before they are born. Cervical cancer, mostly caused by Human papillomavirus (HPV), is a kind of malignant tumour and its incidence is ranked number two next to mammary cancer in the range of female cancer. The data shows that the number of cervical cancer increases 500,000 every year, and the proportion of Chinese is 26%, 130,000 people.

One hour has passed, but I only squeezed 127 words. Making sentences possessing scientific flavour is a big challenge for me and I still have a long way to go.

片刻之前，我阅读了一些关于2价宫颈癌疫苗在中国大陆上市的新闻。而早在11年前，这种类型的疫苗就获得了美国食品和药物管理局的批准。所以下面我将尝试着写一些有关宫颈癌和女性健康的文字。   
什么是宫颈？它是一个位于女性阴道末端，子宫开端的狭窄的通道，而子宫是婴儿出生前所呆的地方。宫颈癌主要是由人乳头瘤病毒 (HPV) 引起的一种恶性肿瘤，其发病率位列女性恶性肿瘤的第二位，仅次于乳腺癌。数据显示，全球每年新增宫颈癌 50万人，而中国就占到了其中的 26%，也就是13 万人。   
一个小时已经过去，但我只挤出了 127 个字。拥有科学味道的造句对我来说仍是一个巨大的挑战，前方还有很长的路要走。

Accompanied by Glorious Day, a music created by Jiaju Huang, I knock her tissue which is responsible for interaction with the outside and she gives me a rapid reply. I tell her that there are 14 people, 2 males and 12 females, and she says: wow, so many girls, I enjoy.

Even as the sound of her voice died away, bewilderment suddenly occupied my whole face. I answer her with a smile: now that you are a girl, why you express yourself singularly excited when meeting same-sex persons? With a hysterical giggle, she says: you know little of what is going on in the world of affairs, don’t you? I reply: yes, yes, yes, I do. She says nothing again but sends a message to me: opposites attract, you are right, now you have stolen my most electricity and I have to say goodbye to you, but I love you, a silly boy!

坐在校园的咖啡厅里，笔记本电脑还剩下57%的电量，我需要在一小时内完成今天的写作。所以你现在肯定知道我的电池坏到怎样的程度了。是的，她服务了我四年，是时候休息休息了。 

伴随着黄家驹的光辉岁月，我敲击着她负责与外界互动的组织，而她快速地回复着我。我告诉她，这里有 14 个人，2 名男性、12 名女性，她说： 哇，这么多的女孩，我喜欢。

她的话音刚落，困惑就突然占领了我整张脸。

我笑着回应她：既然你是一个女孩，为什么你在见到同性时表现得非同寻常的兴奋呢？

她傻笑着说：你孤陋寡闻，不是吗？

我回答：是啊，是啊，是啊，我孤陋寡闻。

她没有再说话，只是给我发了一条消息：异性相吸，你说得对，现在你偷走了我大部分的电，我不得不和你说再见了，但我爱你，傻傻的你！

Today’s noon, a thought glinted in my mind: it had been a long time since I played basketball last time. I bowed my head and consulted my watch, then knew the time is 11:46, which has 14 minutes from off-duty time of the morning. I told myself that there was nothing else for it but to run out, afterwards I galloped across office towards basketball count. I was happy that there are some people. Three minutes later, a game where four persons versus another four persons came at the appointed time. Within 20 minutes, I got 10 points, 2 rebounds and 1 turnover. The 10 points comes from 5-of-8 shooting, containing 1 jump shot, 1 fade-away shot, 2 left wing breakthrough and 1 floater. Shooting streak was so well that I start to suspect my life.

The lavish praise is ended, let us look forward to the future. After 20 to 30 years, our working condition would be summarized with four words: doing as we wish. Because of unprecedented blend of study, life, work and entertainment, the work will not be called work by people either. Our organizations and institutions will operate forward in the environment of high efficiency we never had before, everyone will benefit from that change. Now it seems a beautiful fairyland, but we should not forget: human effort is the decisive factor and nothing is impossible. Work harder, dear fellows! We will be able to see a new generation of management methods which is centered on fair and freedom roots, sprouts, flowers and fruits in our soil. That day, especially that night, we will definitely hang up lanterns and festoons to celebrate check-in systems’ adding to the World Heritage List.

Good night, all my friends

今天中午，一个念头从我心中闪过，好久没打球了。我低头看了下手表，11时46分，离上午下班还有14分钟，这还说个啥，跑啊，然后嗖的一下从办公室飞奔到了篮球场，发现有人在玩，没让我失望。3分钟后，一场4对4的半场比赛如期而至，20分钟内我8投5中豪砍10分2篮板1失误，跳投1个，后仰跳投1个，左路突破2个，抛投1个，手感贼好，好到让我怀疑人生。

牛皮吹完了，眺望一下未来吧，二三十年后，我们的工作状况总结起来应该是四个字：随心所欲。因为同学习、生活、娱乐史无前例地融为一体，工作将不再被人们称之为工作。我们的组织和机构将以前所未有的效率向前运转，我们每一个人都将受益其中。这看起来就像一个美丽的童话世界，但不要忘了：事在人为，一切皆有可能。加油干，同胞们，不久的将来，我们会看到以平等自由为核心的新一代管理方式在世界各地的生根发芽、开花结果，那一天，那一晚，我们将张灯结彩，热烈庆祝打卡制度列入世界文化遗产名录！

晚安，所有的朋友们

Following are something I extracted from the book: Review of Calculus, written by Mingyou Qi, a mathematician in Wuhan University.

以下内容摘自武汉大学数学家齐友民先生所著的《重温微积分》一书。

<div align="center"><p>
<img src="/assets/img/University_Essay/ruc9.2.jpg">
</p></div>

Math is a deductive science which all conclusions should be proved with logical methods. This principle, or rule, was commenced in the age of Pythagoras, then its unshakable tradition was formed gradually in Greek times by many schools, and the perfect embodiment of it belongs to Euclid’s Elements.

数学作为一种演绎推理的科学，即数学中一切结论都应该用逻辑方法加以证明。这个“原则”或者说是“规定”，是从毕达哥拉斯开始的，其后经由希腊时代的许多学派形成了一个不可动摇的传统，而在欧几里得的《几何原本》中得到了完美的体现。

The purpose of that we generously quoted documents published over 2000 years ago is to do a comparison with Calculus we now understand. We may even say: it is the revival of Eudoxus’ Exhaustive Method（using regular polygon to exhaust or approximate circle）, executed by Cauchy and Weierstrass in the middle of 19th century, that accomplishes the base of Calculus. They boiled the variable and the limit down to the inequality, and it could be argued that they indeed had gotten the cream of Eudoxus’ thought. But regrettably, it is this point, the essence of variables’ math, that turns into the accusation of ε-δ, which makes people feel intimidated on Calculus. 

我们不厌其烦地引证了二千多年前的文献，是为了与我们现在都懂得的微积分作一比较。我们甚至不妨说，19世纪中叶，柯西和魏尔斯特拉斯正是复兴了欧多克萨斯的穷竭法（用正多边形穷竭圆，或者说逼近圆），才完成了微积分基础的奠定。他们把变量、极限等等归结为不等式，确是得到了欧多克萨斯的真传。可惜的是，正是这一点成了 ε-δ 的罪名，因为它们使人望而生畏了，然而这正是变量的数学的精华。

After a deep sleep of thousands years, mathematical science was resuscitated in the beginning of capitalistic society, and the requirements of social development had changed. In the 16th and 17th century, mankind faced new mathematical problems. Something important among that are solving the length, the area and the volume of general geometry, solving the tangent of curve, solving the velocity and accelerated speed of motion, solving the maximum and minimum of function and so on. It is clear at first glance for our readers that Calculus was the new science we needed in those days. On the one hand, these problems have specific background of pragmatism, on the other hand, they are closely related to philosophical arguments and the struggle against Catholic theology and Aristoteles’ doctrine for ideological emancipation. The new era calls new giants, they are Descartes, Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton and Leibnitz.

千年沉睡以后，当数学科学再次醒来，人类已经开始进入资本主义时代，社会经济的发展要求变了。到了16和17世纪，人类面临新的数学问题。其中一些重大问题是：求一般几何形体的长度、面积和体积；求曲线的切线；求运动的速度与加速度；求函数的极大值与极小值等等。我们的读者一眼就可以看出，当时人类需要的新科学就是微积分。这些问题一方面有明确的实用背景，但又常与哲学上的争论，与人类争取从天主教神学以及亚里士多德的教条下获得思想解放的斗争紧密联系。新时代呼唤巨人，他们是笛卡尔、哥白尼、伽利略、开普勒、牛顿和莱布尼兹。

<div align="center">

Cauchy pointed out definitely that the limit is a number. If we say A is the limit of function f(x) when x approximates to a, we mean the difference between f(x) and A is arbitrarily small when a series of number representing the variable x approximates to a fixed number ‘a’ immensely and their difference is arbitrarily small. But mathematicians born later on, for example Weierstrass, are still discontented with this definition, they think it still contains trace of geometry and kinematics and should be arithmetized further. What is variable? ‘If an infinite and non-empty set D exits and x can be an arbitrary value in D, the x will be called variable,’ Weierstrass answered. The meaning of lim(x→x0)\[f(x)\] = A is that for every ε>0 we must find δ>0 satisfying \|f(x)-A\|<ε when \|x-a\|<δ. Cauchy and Weierstrass put Calculus on the limit early or later, and Weierstrass even put Calculus on the inequality. We may say Weierstrass cleaned the trace of kinematics as he wished, the math of variable had been static (now that it had been static, people did not need to worry about Zeno’s paradoxes). That is Calculus our readers have learned. 

柯西明确指出，极限就是一个数，所谓变量x趋向a时函数f(x) 以A为极限就是指：若代表变量x的一串数值无限地趋近固定数a且其差可以任意地小时，f(x)与A之差也可以任意小。但是稍后的数学家如魏尔斯特拉斯仍然对此定义不满，认为这仍包含了几何学与运动学的痕迹，应该更进一步算术化。变量是什么？魏尔斯特拉斯给的回答是：若有一个无限非空集合D，而x可以取D中任一元素为其值，则x就称为一个变量。lim(x→x0)\[f(x)\] = A的意思就是：任给 ε>0 必可找到 δ>0，使得当 \|x-a\|<δ 时，\|f(x)-A\|<ε. 先是柯西，再继之以魏尔斯特拉斯，把整个微积分放在了极限的基础上，而后又放在了不等式的基础上。可以说，魏尔斯特拉斯如愿以偿地清洗了运动学的痕迹，变量的数学静态化了（既已静态化，也就用不着再为芝诺悖论操心了）。这就是读者们学过了的微积分。

So what is derivative? It is the limit. What is the integral? It is the limit. What is infinite series? It is still the limit. What is the limit? It is the number. What is the number? It should be dated back to the first mathematical crisis of ancient Greek. Please see G.Cantor’s answer: √3 is only a uncertain symbol of number, but not its definition. However, using my method, we can define approvingly it as {1.7,1.73,1.732…}. G.Cantor’s meaning is that real should be defined and one of methods is to define it as a series of rational number possessing special properties. His method solves the confusion of Pythagoras and realize one-to-one correspondence between points in the straight line and numbers, which is the base of analytic geometry and algebraizates whole geometry.

于是我们可以看到：什么是导数？是极限；什么是积分？也是极限；什么是无穷级数？还是极限。那什么是极限？极限是数。那什么是数？这就要追溯到古希腊的第一次数学危机。请看康托尔的回答：√3 只是一个尚未确定的数的符号，而不是它的定义。然而，用我的方法可以满意地给出它的定义为：{1.7,1.73,1.732,…}. 康托尔的话的意思是：实数需要定义，其方法之一是定义实数为一个具有特定性质的有理数序列。康托尔用这样的方法解决了毕达哥拉斯的困惑，使得直线上每一点都对应一个数，每一个数也对应一个点，这是解析几何的基础，也把整个几何“算术化”了。

About 200 years ago, Alembert described math in those days using an inspiring slogan: go ahead and you will have faith. Now the situation is that mankind has enough faith and we are going ahead.

大约两百年前，达朗贝尔用一句鼓舞人心的口号来描述当时的数学：“前进吧，你就会有信心”，而现在的情况则是：人类正充满信心，人类正在前进！

My perspectives on management

我的管理观

<div align="center"><p>
<img src="/assets/img/University_Essay/ruc10.2.jpg">
</p></div>

I have never managed somebody, so it may be a joke for me to talk about management. But this situation cannot prevent me from expressing my viewpoints on it. If they are right, I will put them into practice one day. If they are wrong, they can be precious records of development track of my thought.

我从没有管理过别人，所以我来谈论管理可能让人见笑。但是这样的状况无法阻止我表达我的管理观点。如果这些观点是对的，我将在未来付诸实践。如果这些观点是错的，它们将成为我思想发展道路上的宝贵记录。

My opinions are based on my Weltanschauung: the greatest truths are the simplest. The purpose of management is to make our team run effectively, the key to realize it is our team members as the saying——human effort is the decisive factor——goes. Therefore, we can use four words——assembling feelings of people——to describe the kernel of management.

我的观点基于我的世界观：大道至简。管理的目的是让我们的组织得以高效运转，这其中的关键是团队的成员，正所谓事在人为。因此，我们可以用四个字形容管理的核心，那就是：凝聚人心。

In fact, rules and regulations cannot restrain people at all times, because subordinates have their own countermeasures against superiors’ policies. But feelings can be a perfect constraint on managed persons’ behavior. We even should not use the word ‘constraint’, because the sense of belonging to the team will make them contribute their energy towards the team spontaneously. Imaging that you are facing a manager who wants to know your growth experiences and feelings, your true intention taking part in the team, your future plan and your dream, and imaging that he even wishes to learn from you and help you realize your dream though you will have to leave his team one day, what feelings will you have?

事实上，靠规章和制度从来都无法限制住人，因为上有政策下有对策。但是情感却能完美地约束被管理者的行为。我们甚至不应该使用“约束”这样的词汇，因为对于团队的归属感会让他们自发地将他们的能量贡献给团队。想象一下你的领导是这样一个人：他渴望去了解你的成长经历和感受，了解你来到团队的真正意图，了解你未来的计划和你的梦想，他甚至愿意向你学习，并帮助你去实现你的梦想，即使有一天你不得不离开他的团队，你将会有怎样的感受呢？

It seems that assembling feelings of people can be talked freely but cannot be done easily. However, as a managed person for a long time when my parents and my teachers supervised me, I gradually find that the difficulty of it comes from inequality between the regulator and the regulated. We are used to educate people younger than us with our experience confidently rather than listen to their ideas as if we are standing in a higher and more correct stage.

凝聚人心似乎是一件说起来容易做起来难的事。然而，作为一个长期的被管理者，包括被父母和被老师管理，我逐渐发现这种困难其实来自于管理者和被管理者的不平等。我们习惯于用我们的经验理直气壮地教育比我们年轻的人，而不是去倾听他们的想法，就好像我们站在了一个视野更开阔，观点更正确的位置上。

The base of communication of heart is equality. It is hard for us to imagine that one person shares his true feelings with another person who often lays out a superior attitude consciously or unconsciously. Therefore, assembling feelings of people is easy as long as our managers lay down the pose of manager, go into the depths of their staffs’ soul initiatively and regard them as his friends and teachers. The core of it is listening instead of preaching.

心灵沟通的基础是平等。我们很难想象一个人愿意向一个有意或无意地将自己摆在一个更高姿态的人表达自己真实的想法。因此，只要管理者愿意放下自己管理者的姿态, 主动地走进员工的灵魂深处，并把他们视为自己的朋友和老师，凝聚人心就是一件很简单的事了。这一切的关键是用聆听代替说教。

Mankind is a perceptual animal. The actually effective communication is a talking hitting the depth of soul. The times belong to youngers living in this times. These three simple truths are sources of my perspectives on management.

人类是一种感性动物，真正有效的沟通是直达灵魂深处的交流，时代永远属于身处这个时代的年轻人，这三个简单的道理便是我管理观点的根源所在。

If something is wrong, please correct me, thank you!

如有错误，敬请指正，蟹蟹

Happy Teacher’s Day to all teachers, the happiest thing learning in normal university is that you can see many young faces in Wechat Circle, they are the hope of our future world!

祝所有的老师们教师节快乐，在师范大学读书最幸福的事莫过于你可以在微信朋友圈看到许许多多年轻的面孔，他们是未来世界的希望!

The implication of fallen flowers
——the first poem writing for future:

Silently at noon yesterday,
the flowers were fading.
Because of forgetting its name,
you turned to consult me.
But I say I know nothing.

A long time had passed,
then a laughter came out suddenly.
You regarded me as a fake,
fake scientist in detail.
Actually I could not argue.

That night I lit my lamp to read,
bit lips, beat breast and stamped feet
only for reshaping status or prestige.
But I failed to imagine its difficulties,
which equal the Shu Road or the heaven.

Coldly at morning today,
the heat originated from back
made meditation fruit.
You brought a wind coat to me,
then I knew the implication of fallen flowers.

落花之意：写给未来的诗1

昨日寂静午间
行将衰落的花
你想不起名字
于是转身问我
我说我也不知

此后许久过了
突然笑声传出
你称我是冒牌
冒牌的科学家
我竟无力辩解

是夜挑灯苦读
咬牙捶胸顿足
只为重拾颜面
不想个中荆棘
比肩蜀道青天

今日刺骨清晨
忽觉背后一热
冥思终成正果
你把风衣送来
我明落花之意

Today, basketball accompanied me all day and sent me a present——crus cramp——which makes me have no choice but to use study instead of sport. Now my heart can be seen as a mixture of sadness and joy, how interesting it is!

Wangyi Cloud Music tells me that frequency of the word ‘heart’ equaling 993 hit the top position among all lyrics I have ever heard in 2017. It exceeds my expectation but within the bound of reason.

She also mentions me that 24th Feb may be a special day for me since I listened to Fifth Melody of the Night performed by Shi Jin many times. However, I really cannot grasp its particularity, I do not know why 47 became the amount of listening to that music on that day as if I do not understand how do I possess the present appearance step by step. 

Extremely the world is fantastic, she always bringing curiosity into our heart with no end.

今天，篮球陪伴了我一天并送给我一份礼物：小腿抽筋，这让我除了用学习代替运动外别无选择。现在我的心悲喜交加，多么有意思！

网易云音乐告诉我2017我听到最多的歌词是“心”，达到993次，这既出乎我意料，又在情理之中。

她还提醒我，对我而言，2月24日也许是特别的一天，因为我把石进的《夜的钢琴曲五》听了很多次。然而，我真的不知道特别在何处，我不知道为什么那一天听这首曲子听了47次，就好像我无法理解我是如何一步一步成为今天这般模样的。

这世界如此奇妙，它总把好奇植入我们内心，并且源源不断。

用英文写日记实在是件遭罪的事，我偷回懒。

中国的大学什么时候能成为中国的大学呢? 我是指：什么时候我们可以脱口而出：我有一个想法，我来做个展示，而不是脱口而出：我有一个idea，我来做个presentation.

因为落后，我们学习了人家这么多年，该有点骨气做点超越人家的事，比如，有一天，让汉语成为西方研究生入学考试的必考科目。

昨天网易云带着她对用户听歌的记录刷爆朋友圈，今天支付宝带着他对用户消费的记录同样刷爆朋友圈。他和她，一个管着物质，一个管着精神，他和她，好像牛郎和织女，离牵手只差一座桥的距离。

过去的一年是漂泊的一年，他告诉我，说我一共坐了17次火车，花费3497.50元，这数字多少超出了我的意料。2次往返于长春和长沙，3次往返于长春和北京，1次往返于长春和哈尔滨，1次去往北京，1次去往长沙，1次去往益阳，还有2次忘了。平均每次205.73元，有点小贵，至今可恶的花呗小朋友还时不时拽着我的手，嚷嚷着：欠债还钱，天经地义。

全年总消费14226.25元，月均1185.52元，加上其他渠道的消费，实际应该在1500到2000之间吧，不知道算什么水平，唯一肯定的是花了不少冤枉钱。当然像北京房租这种大贪官不在统计范围内，他必须被剔除出去，以告慰天下苍生。

Snowflakes
——the 2th poem written for future

In the south of China,
many snowflakes with dust
fall onto highways and byways.

With each other,
sprays on the window
bond, play and have fun.
Now and then, one by one,
they make many drawings naturally.

Children waken from dream
are discontented with natural presents.
On sprays with young hands carefully,
they depict snowflakes in their eyes.

To take advantage of free time,
adults returning from work
are also unwilling to fall behind.
In the place where children cannot reach,
by staring at remote mountain,
they confide stories in their heart.

Because of the continuity of the creation,
you eventually crawl out from warm bed.
In that moment,
the cold wind swallow you.
But suddenly,
winter clothes, neckerchief,
together with ginger decoction,
throng into the house.

Through the arts in window,
you say you have observed
pureness, kindness and honesty,
and have touched
gladness, gratitude and happiness,
and also have tasted
all the beauty of human world
which cast light on by snowflakes.

I ask you what the beauty is.
You answer me without thinking:
it is friendship, romance and familial affection.
Smiling with shyness, you speak again:
It is also the love which includes the above three.
The loving process converts two persons’ relationship 
from the stranger into the friend firstly,
from the friend into the sweetheart secondly,
and from the sweetheart into the relative ultimately.

雪花：写给未来的诗2

中国南方
粒粒雪花
夹杂尘土
飘落
大街小巷

窗上水雾
你来我往
嬉戏打闹
不时勾勒出
一幅幅
浑然天成的图画

从梦中苏醒的孩子
对这自然的馈赠
并不满意
他们拖着稚嫩的双手
在这水雾上
一笔一划
描绘着
他们眼里的雪花

劳作归来的大人
趁着这难得的闲暇
也不甘落后
他们望着远方的大山
在孩子们够不着的地方
一点一线
诉说着
他们心中的故事

如火如荼的创作
终于让你爬出温暖被窝
那一刹
刺骨寒风吞没了你
但很快
冬衣围巾
加上姜汤
纷至沓来

透过窗户上的艺术品
你说你看到了
纯洁、善良与真诚
触摸到了
欣喜、感动和幸福
也品尝到了
雪花映照下的
人间一切美好

我问你
这美好指什么
你不假思索
友情、恋情、亲情啊
又含羞一笑
还有囊括三者的爱情
从外人，到朋友
从朋友，到恋人
从恋人，到亲人
